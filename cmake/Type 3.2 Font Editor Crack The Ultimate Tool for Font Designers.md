## What is Type 3.2 Font Editor?
 
Type 3.2 is a font editor developed by CR8 Software Solutions[^1^] [^2^], a company that has been creating software solutions for font creation and card printing since 2006. Type 3.2 is the latest version of their font editor, which boasts several innovative and easy-to-use features to help you create awesome looking fonts.
 
Type 3.2 supports various font formats, such as TrueType, OpenType, PostScript and SVG fonts. You can also create and edit variable fonts with one or more axes of variation, which allow unlimited variations of a font to be selected on the fly by the end user. Additionally, you can create, edit and convert between different colour font formats, such as Microsoft Layer, SVG and Apple colour fonts.
 
Type 3.2 also has a unique autotracer feature that takes the guesswork out of vectorising handwriting and drawings. You can see a real-time preview as you adjust filter and trace settings, and then import the vectorised glyphs into your font. Moreover, you can get a real-time preview of characters as you edit and create them, and then view your typeface at various type sizes and line spacings with Type 3.2's full-font preview.
 
Another feature that makes Type 3.2 stand out is its composite glyph wizard, which takes the hard work out of diacritics. You can add accented characters to your typeface within seconds by simply selecting the base character and the accent from a list. Type 3.2 will automatically position and combine them into a composite glyph.
